# Text-editor
 This is a the text editor project for python programmers

 Note: this is my first project, it is not intended to be use. It is a project for learning purposes.
       The program is not really well organized and there's no documentation.
       I wrote it to show my style of programming and learn more about the tkinter modules

 The name of this text editor will be MEditor
 That's because my name starts with M (really, nothing creative)

 Things yet to be implemented...
 *1) Change color option (when text is in pyhton highlight mode)
 *2) Docstring highlight algorithm
 *3) 'X' button right after the tab name to close the tab
