# text-editor
 This is a the text editor project for python programmers.
 It is written to run with Python 3.

 Note: this is my first project, it is not intended to be used. It is a project for learning purposes.
       The program is not really well organized and there's no documentation.
       I wrote it to show my style of programming and learn more about the tkinter modules.

 The name of this text editor will be MEditor.

 Things yet to be implemented...
 * Change color option (when text is in pyhton highlight mode)
 * Docstring highlight algorithm
 * 'X' button right after the tab name to close the tab
